    <h3>About HungryMan</h3>
    <p>
      HungryMan was born out of a deep love for food, code, and creativity. As a passionate front-end developer with a hunger for great UI and an even greater hunger for delicious recipes, I wanted to create something meaningful — a platform where anyone can explore, share, and savor food from all walks of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're a home cook or a professional chef, HungryMan is for you. This isn't just a recipe app — it's a celebration of cultures, tastes, and stories told through ingredients and spices. I built this platform with Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB to blend the flavors of technology and gastronomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is just the beginning. I hope HungryMan inspires you to cook more, share more, and eat well. Because every recipe is a story — and I want HungryMan to be a place where yours gets told.
